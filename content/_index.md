# GoboLinux Wiki

## Welcome !

Hello and welcome to the official documentation and wiki of the GoboLinux
project!

GoboLinux is [quite](https://gobolinux.org/k5.html)
[different](https://gobolinux.org/at_a_glance.html) from your usual linux
distribution. Therefore to make your journey as enjoyable possible, you should
carefully **read** and **consult** the documentation.

If you have just installed GoboLinux on your PC, make sure to check out the
[Known Issues and Fixes]({{<ref "Structure" >}})
section first.

## How to find yourself around

You can start with the [**Overview**]({{<ref "Website" >}}) section on the
left. This should get you started.



### Couldn't find what you were looking for?

GoboLinux is a very broad project, that has its roots back to almighty 2002!
Thus you might find outdated or even missing documentation... but do not
despair!!

everybody out.
